## Advanced Usage Tips

### Time Range Specifications

The MCP server supports flexible time range formats:

1. **Unix timestamps** (milliseconds): `1742369820000`
2. **Natural language**: `"last 24 hours"`, `"last 2 days"`, `"last 1 hour"`
3. **Datetime with timezone**: `"19 March 2026, 2:47 PM|IST"`, `"20 March 2026, 10:00 AM|UTC"`
4. **Datetime without timezone** (defaults to UTC): `"19 March 2026, 2:47 PM"`

### Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- **Authentication Errors**: Verify API token permissions and expiration
- **Empty Results**: Check time ranges and filter criteria
- **Timeout Errors**: Reduce time range or add more specific filters
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure user has appropriate access levels

### Filtering and Grouping

Most tools support advanced filtering using tag filter expressions. You can use simple filters or combine them with logical operators.

#### Simple Tag Filter

```json
{
  "type": "TAG_FILTER",
  "name": "service.name",
  "operator": "EQUALS",
  "entity": "DESTINATION",
  "value": "payment-service"
}
```

**Supported Operators:** `EQUALS`, `NOT_EQUAL`, `CONTAINS`, `NOT_CONTAIN`, `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`, `GREATER_THAN`, `LESS_THAN`

#### Complex Filters with OR Logic

Filter for multiple namespaces (production OR staging):

```json
{
  "type": "EXPRESSION",
  "logicalOperator": "OR",
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "TAG_FILTER",
      "name": "kubernetes.namespace.name",
      "operator": "EQUALS",
      "entity": "DESTINATION",
      "value": "production"
    },
    {
      "type": "TAG_FILTER",
      "name": "kubernetes.namespace.name",
      "operator": "EQUALS",
      "entity": "DESTINATION",
      "value": "staging"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Prompt:**
```
Show me application metrics for services in either production or staging namespace
```

#### Complex Filters with AND Logic

Filter for payment service with HTTP errors (status > 400):

```json
{
  "type": "EXPRESSION",
  "logicalOperator": "AND",
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "TAG_FILTER",
      "name": "service.name",
      "operator": "EQUALS",
      "entity": "DESTINATION",
      "value": "payment-service"
    },
    {
      "type": "TAG_FILTER",
      "name": "call.http.status",
      "operator": "GREATER_THAN",
      "entity": "DESTINATION",
      "value": "400"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Prompt:**
```
Show me all calls to payment-service that returned HTTP status codes greater than 400
```

#### Nested Expressions

Combine AND/OR logic for complex scenarios:

```json
{
  "type": "EXPRESSION",
  "logicalOperator": "AND",
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "EXPRESSION",
      "logicalOperator": "OR",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "TAG_FILTER",
          "name": "kubernetes.namespace.name",
          "operator": "EQUALS",
          "entity": "DESTINATION",
          "value": "production"
        },
        {
          "type": "TAG_FILTER",
          "name": "kubernetes.namespace.name",
          "operator": "EQUALS",
          "entity": "DESTINATION",
          "value": "staging"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "TAG_FILTER",
      "name": "service.name",
      "operator": "CONTAINS",
      "entity": "DESTINATION",
      "value": "payment"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Prompt:**
```
Show me metrics for payment-related services in production or staging environments
```

### Combining Tools

Step 2: Get staging metrics
"Show me application metrics for services in the staging namespace"

Step 3: Compare error rates
"Compare error rates between production and staging for the API Gateway service"

Step 4: Check configuration differences
"Show me application perspective configurations for production and staging"
```

#### Scenario 5: Website Performance Analysis

**Workflow:** Analyze user experience → Identify bottlenecks → Correlate with backend

```
Step 1: Get website beacon data
"Show me page load times grouped by page name for the E-commerce website in the last hour"

Step 2: Analyze by geography
"Show me page load performance by country for users experiencing slow load times"

Step 3: Check browser impact
"Compare page load times across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari"

Step 4: Correlate with backend services
"Show me latency metrics for the API services called by the slow-loading pages"

Step 5: Check for errors
"Get all error beacons from the website in the last hour"
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with list operations, then drill down to specific resources
2. **Use catalog operations**: Check available metrics and tags before querying
3. **Leverage time ranges**: Use appropriate time windows for your analysis
4. **Group and aggregate**: Use grouping to identify patterns across multiple entities
5. **Combine filters**: Use multiple filter criteria to precisely target your analysis
