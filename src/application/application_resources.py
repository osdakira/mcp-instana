    #     Retrieve a list of services from Instana. A use case could be to view the service id, or details,or information of a Service.
    #     This tool is useful when you need to get information about all services across your monitored environment,regardless of which application perspective they belong to.
    #     You can filter by service name and other parameters to narrow down results.Use this when you want to see what services exist in your system, understand their IDs .
    #     This is particularly helpful when you need to retrieve service IDs for further analysis or monitoring. For example, use this tool when asked about 'all services',
    #     'list services across applications', or when someone wants to 'get service information without application context'. A use case could be to view the service ID of a specific Service.
